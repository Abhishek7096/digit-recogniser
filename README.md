# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes training the model, deploying it as a web API using Flask, and deploying it on Heroku for easy access.

## Features

- **CNN Model:** Trains a TensorFlow/Keras CNN on the MNIST dataset.
- **Flask API:** Provides a web API endpoint for real-time predictions.
- **Heroku Deployment:** Hosts the model as a web service on Heroku.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
